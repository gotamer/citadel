## HowTo use

### Create a config file

	citadelsync -n contacts
	nano contacts.cfg.json

### Edit the config file `contacts.cfg.json`
```
{
	"Version": 3,
	"Environment": 1,
	"LocalDir": "/home/username/PIM/contacts",
	"Room": "Contacts",
	"Username": "TaMeR",
	"Password": "God knows what",
	"Server": "localhost",
	"Port": ":504",
	"Floor": "Not implemented",
	"SSL_KEY": "Not yet implemented",
	"SSL_CER": "Not yet implemented"
}
```

#### Version:
Do not change unless prompted after an upgrade.

#### Environment:

	1. Production
	2. Info mode, prints a lot of info in to the log file
	3. Debug mode, will print to screen, and exit if it finds something not quite right

#### LocalDir:
Point to the local folder containing your vCards, vNotes etc. files.
You should make a folder for each type, since each folder will represent a room in the [Citadel] server.

 - Citadel `Contacts` to the `contacts` folder
 - Citadel `Tasks` to the tasks` folder
 - etc.

#### Room:
The Citadel Room to upload to

#### Username and Password
Your Citadel username or password.
Keep empty "" to specify on the command line.

#### Server:
Your Citadel hostname, such as `example.com`

#### Port:
Your Citadel port. The standard port is 504 if you haven't changed it on the server.

### Populate your sync directory

Your sync directory is:

	"LocalDir": "/home/username/PIM/contacts"

In this example we would place our vCard files in to this directory

*Files must be individual files each holding a single entry

____________________________________________________
### Copy to Citadel

Now the setup is done!

Following command will copy all files to the Citadel server.

	citadelsync -n contacts

This will

 1. Check your server connection
 2. Your login information
 3.	The availability of the room
 4. The compatibillity of the room with your file type
 5. Your `LocalDir` sync directory

If everything checks out it will upload all files from your LocalDir to the specified Room on the local or remote Citadel Server.
____________________________________________________
### Notes

 * Files must be individual files each holding a single entry residing in one folder, anywhere on your computer or device.

 * Citadel Sync remembers the state of your files and will only upload modified files

 * Citadel Sync will not delete or modify any files it didn't upload, unless you use the -D flag.

 * A file with the extension `*.db.json` will be created. Please do not modify this file by hand!!!
